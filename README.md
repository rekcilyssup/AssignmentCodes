Key Areas pylint Checks:
PEP8 Compliance (Style Guide):

Ensures your code follows Python's official style guide (PEP8).
Checks for proper indentation, line length (usually 79 or 100 characters), spacing, and naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
Your code likely adheres to these rules, with consistent formatting and naming.
Code Quality:

Avoids duplicate code and ensures modularity.
Encourages the use of meaningful variable and function names.
Your code might be well-structured, with clear and concise functions and no unnecessary repetition.
Error Detection:

Identifies potential bugs, such as undefined variables, unused imports, or unreachable code.
Your code likely avoids these issues, with all variables and imports being used appropriately.
Logical Issues:

Warns about things like unused variables, redefined variables, or overly complex functions.
Your code might be simple and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
Documentation:

Checks for docstrings in modules, classes, and functions.
Your code might include proper docstrings explaining the purpose of each function or class.
Code Metrics:

Measures cyclomatic complexity (how complex your functions are).
Encourages smaller, simpler functions with fewer branches (e.g., if/else).
Your code might have simple, focused functions that are easy to understand.
Imports:

Ensures imports are used and organized correctly.
Your code likely avoids unused imports and follows the correct order (standard library, third-party, local imports).
Best Practices:

Encourages Pythonic code (e.g., using list comprehensions, avoiding global variables).
Your code might use idiomatic Python constructs effectively.
